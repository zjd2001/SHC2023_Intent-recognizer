# SHC2023_Intent-recognizer

The deep intent recognition model based on Word2Vec-BiLSTM utilizes the unique gate control mechanism of the LSTM model to effectively capture the dependencies in the sequence, while the Word2Vec method effectively solves the problem of ignoring word relevance in traditional methods and the problem of only extracting local semantic features of text in CNN models. The accuracy on the SHC2023 dataset reaches 92.7%.

A user-friendly interactive interface was also designed, forming an intelligent home dialog intent retrieval system, achieving seamless integration of technology and application. The operation interface was written using a graphical user interface (GUI) library, including voice input and history record query functions, ensuring the system's usability, readability, etc.
